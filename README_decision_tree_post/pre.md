# Machine Learning Learning Log

This repository contains my hands-on learning, experiments, and notes while studying machine learning using Python and scikit-learn.

## Structure
datasets – dataset-based experiments (Iris, Wine, etc.)
models – model-specific notebooks
concepts` – notes on ML concepts (overfitting, cross-validation)

## Purpose
Learning and experimentation.  
Projects are maintained in separate repositories.
